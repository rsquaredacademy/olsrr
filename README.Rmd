## Usage

olsrr uses consistent prefix `ols_` for easy tab completion.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(olsrr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(nortest)
library(goftest)
```

olsrr is built with the aim of helping those users who are new to the R language. If you know how to 
write a `formula` or build models using `lm`, you will find olsrr very useful. Most of the functions
use an object of class `lm` as input. So you just need to build a model using `lm` and then pass it onto 
the functions in olsrr. Below is a quick demo:

#### Regression

```{r regress}
ols_regress(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt + qsec, data = mtcars)
```

#### Stepwise Regression

Build regression model from a set of candidate predictor variables by entering and removing predictors based on 
p values, in a stepwise manner until there is no variable left to enter or remove any more.

#### Variable Selection

```{r stepwise1}
# stepwise regression
model <- lm(y ~ ., data = surgical)
ols_step_both_p(model)
```

#### Stepwise AIC Backward Regression

Build regression model from a set of candidate predictor variables by removing predictors based on 
Akaike Information Criteria, in a stepwise manner until there is no variable left to remove any more.

##### Variable Selection

```{r stepaicb1}
# stepwise aic backward regression
model <- lm(y ~ ., data = surgical)
k <- ols_step_backward_aic(model)
k
```

#### Breusch Pagan Test

Breusch Pagan test is used to test for herteroskedasticity (non-constant error variance). It tests whether the variance of the errors from a regression is dependent on the values of the independent variables. It is a $\chi^{2}$ test.

```{r bp1}
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt + drat, data = mtcars)
ols_test_breusch_pagan(model)
```

#### Collinearity Diagnostics

```{r colldiag}
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt + qsec, data = mtcars)
ols_coll_diag(model)
```
