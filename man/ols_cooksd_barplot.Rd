\title{Cooks' D Bar Plot}
\usage{
ols_cooksd_barplot(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \code{lm}}
}
\value{
\code{ols_cooksd_barplot} returns  a list containing the
following components:

\item{outliers}{a tibble with observation number and \code{cooks distance} that exceed \code{threshold}}
\item{threshold}{\code{threshold} for classifying an observation as an outlier}
}
\description{
Bar Plot of cook's distance to detect observations that strongly influence fitted values of the model.
}
\details{
Cook's distance was introduced by American statistician R Dennis Cook in 1977. It is used
to identify influential data points. It depends on both the residual and leverage i.e it takes it account
both the \emph{x} value and \emph{y} value of the observation.

Steps to compute Cook's distance:

\itemize{
  \item Delete observations one at a time.
  \item Refit the regression model on remaining \eqn{n - 1} observations
  \item examine how much all of the fitted values change when the ith observation is deleted.
}

A data point having a large cook's d indicates that the data point strongly influences the fitted values.
