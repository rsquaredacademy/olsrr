ols_plot_added_variable(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{lm}.}
}
\description{
Added variable plot provides information about the marginal importance of a
predictor variable, given the other predictor variables already in
the model. It shows the marginal importance of the variable in reducing the
residual variability.
}
\details{
The added variable plot was introduced by Mosteller and Tukey
(1977). It enables us to visualize the regression coefficient of a new
variable being considered to be included in a model. The plot can be
constructed for each predictor variable.

Let us assume we want to test the effect of adding/removing variable \emph{X} from a
model. Let the response variable of the model be \emph{Y}

Steps to construct an added variable plot:

\itemize{
  \item Regress \emph{Y} on all variables other than \emph{X} and store the residuals (\emph{Y} residuals).
  \item Regress \emph{X} on all the other variables included in the model (\emph{X} residuals).
  \item Construct a scatter plot of \emph{Y} residuals and \emph{X} residuals.
}

What do the \emph{Y} and \emph{X} residuals represent? The \emph{Y} residuals represent the part
of \strong{Y} not explained by all the variables other than X. The \emph{X} residuals
represent the part of \strong{X} not explained by other variables. The slope of the line
fitted to the points in the added variable plot is equal to the regression
coefficient when \strong{Y} is regressed on all variables including \strong{X}.

A strong linear relationship in the added variable plot indicates the increased
importance of the contribution of \strong{X} to the model already containing the
other predictors.
